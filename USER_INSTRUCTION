Great! Here's a clear **"👤 USER INSTRUCTIONS"** section you can directly paste into your `README.md` file or show on your app for users who'll run it:

## 👤 USER INSTRUCTIONS

Follow these steps to use the ChatGroq PDF QA app:

### 📥 Step 1: Add Your PDFs

- Place your PDF files inside the `RL/` folder.
- These files will be used to create vector embeddings for question answering.

---

### ⚙️ Step 2: Run the Application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will open the app in your default browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

---

### 🧠 Step 3: Create Document Embeddings

- Click the **"Create Document Embeddings"** button.
- The app will process your PDFs and prepare them for querying using embeddings and FAISS.

> 📌 This step only needs to be done once unless you change the PDFs.

---

### ❓ Step 4: Ask Your Questions

- Enter your question in the input field (e.g., *"What is the main objective of the document?"*).
- The app will:
  - Retrieve the most relevant chunks from the PDFs
  - Use the **Groq LLM (Mixtral)** to generate an accurate answer
- You’ll see:
  - The final **answer**
  - The **documents used for reference** (in expandable section)
  - The **response time** for the answer

### 🔁 Optional: Update or Add New PDFs

If you add or replace files in the `RL/` folder:
- Click **"Create Document Embeddings"** again to update the vector store.

---

### 🧑‍💻 Troubleshooting

- 🔑 **API Keys Not Found?** Make sure your `.env` file exists and includes:
  ```env
  OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
  GROQ_API_KEY=your_key_here
  ```

- 🧠 **Error: "Please create document embeddings first!"**
  → Click the **"Create Document Embeddings"** button.
